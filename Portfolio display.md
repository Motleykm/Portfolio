#  Portfolio
### Tools & Technology 
Hello , I am aspiring developer interested in future developing my skills in C# and eventually learn other languages.This project is designed to highlight tools and concepts that Im exploring and continuing to familiarize myself about.This project is also displaying the concepts that I learned throughout the time I attended Fullsail University in a form of application that Im currently working on called "Triplists". This App will allow the user to keep track of expenses spent on a trip. 



##Code Exploration:

This link will take you to the concepts and notes and work in progress related to my ongoing project completion.

At the begining of this program , the user will be taken to this screen called the program class.This is the initial entry point of the   of a program  that lets the user know what is the application is about. 


It will be displayed something like this :

Exmaple Code Here


 
```c#
namespace TripLists
{
    class Program
    {//entry point to the program 
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the Triplists App.. where you can track all trip expenses");
            var project = new App();

        }
```
